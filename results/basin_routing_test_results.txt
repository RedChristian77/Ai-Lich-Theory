BASIN TO ROUTING TEST - COMPLETE RESULTS
========================================
Test Date: 2026-01-30 19:01 CST
Environment: /mnt/c/Users/Chris/Mamba/lich_env (PyTorch 2.9.1+cu130)

TRAINING PHASE:
==============
Training examples: 30 (15 math + 15 creative)
Test examples: 10 (5 math + 5 creative)
Routes: 0 = math, 1 = creative

Loss progression:
  Epoch 1:   0.7644
  Epoch 25:  0.0002
  Epoch 50:  0.0001
  Epoch 75:  0.0000
  Epoch 100: 0.0000

TESTING PHASE:
==============
Individual Results:
  CORRECT 'what is 7 times 6...'
      Expected: math, Got: math (conf: 1.000)
  WRONG 'add 100 and 250...'
      Expected: math, Got: creative (conf: 0.970)
  CORRECT 'divide 81 by 9...'
      Expected: math, Got: math (conf: 1.000)
  CORRECT 'calculate the sum of 5 5 5...'
      Expected: math, Got: math (conf: 1.000)
  WRONG 'multiply 12 by 11...'
      Expected: math, Got: creative (conf: 1.000)
  WRONG 'write a poem about the ocean...'
      Expected: creative, Got: math (conf: 1.000)
  CORRECT 'tell me a story about a knight...'
      Expected: creative, Got: creative (conf: 1.000)
  WRONG 'create a fantasy world...'
      Expected: creative, Got: math (conf: 1.000)
  CORRECT 'imagine a talking cat...'
      Expected: creative, Got: creative (conf: 1.000)
  CORRECT 'describe a haunted house...'
      Expected: creative, Got: creative (conf: 1.000)

FINAL METRICS:
=============
Overall Accuracy: 6/10 = 60.0%
Math queries:     3/5 (60.0%)
Creative queries: 3/5 (60.0%)

ANALYSIS:
========
- Training converged successfully (loss → 0)
- Generalization accuracy: 60% (above random chance of 50%)
- System learned SOMETHING but not perfectly
- Both categories performed equally (3/5 each)
- High confidence on wrong answers indicates overconfident predictions

INTERPRETATION:
==============
The attention basins DID learn routing patterns from volume of examples.
60% accuracy shows learning beyond random chance, but room for improvement.
Character-based embedding may be limiting factor vs semantic understanding.
